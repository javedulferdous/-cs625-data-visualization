CS 625, Fall 2020

## Setting up your report 

1. Replace my name with your name in the 
```
author: "Dr. Michele Weigle"
```
line at the top of this file.  You'll do this for every report that you submit.

2. Remove this section "Setting up your report" before submitting your report.

## Git, GitHub

1. *What is your GitHub username?*
=> javedulferdous

2. *What is the URL of your remote GitHub repo (created through Mr. Kennedy's exercises)?*
=> https://github.com/cs625-datavis-fall20/hw1-setup-javedulferdous.git
## R

The command below will load the tidyverse package.  If you have installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package, it should display a list of loaded packages and their versions.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown 

1. *Create an ordered bulleted list with at least 3 items*
=> 1. Item 1
   2. Item 2
   3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b

2. *Write a paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, and code.*
=> This is a demonstration of *italics*, **bold**, ***bold italic*** , ```Code ```

3. *Create an example of a fenced code block.*

```
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

4. *Create a level 4 heading*
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

## R 

#### Data Visualization Exercises

1. *Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?*
=> It creates an empty plot

2. *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*
=> row 234, column 11
3. *What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.*

4. *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*
![hwy vs cyl](report_files/figure-gfm/Rplot.png)

5. *What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?*
![class vs drv](report_files/figure-gfm/Rplot01.png)

#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. *Why does this code not work?*

```r
my_variable <- 10
my_varÄ±able
```
=> There is '1' instead of having i in my_variable.

2. *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:*

```r
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```
=> 
```r
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
filter(mpg, cyl == 8)

filter(diamonds, carat > 3)

```

3. *Press Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?*
=> The keyboard shortcuts help display appears.

## Tableau

*Insert your the image of your final bar chart here*

1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*


## Observable and Vega-Lite

### A Taste of Observable

1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?*
=> Forcast description became more shorter. ususally it was like two words to describe each day weather condition.

1. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?*
=> The marks on the graph take a square shape when we replace markCircle() with markSquare(). Using markPoint() the all square point became small ring circle.

1. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?*
=> Pick Location : Longitude: -77.11     Latitude: 37.41.
   Picked a point near Norfolk, VA.


1. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  Insert the PNG into your report.*
![Weather Chart](report_files/figure-gfm/a-taste-of-observable.png)

### Charting with Vega-Lite

1. *Pass an option of { size: 200 } to markCircle().*
=> The size of the *circle* marks have increased to 200 unit.
![](report_files/figure-gfm/vega-lite.png)

1. *Try markSquare instead of markCircle.*
=> The shaped of marks changed from *circular* to *square*.
![](report_files/figure-gfm/markSquare.png)

1. *Try markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' }).*
=> The size of the marks is back to default and shape in changed to diamond.
![](report_files/figure-gfm/diamond.png)

1. *Change Horsepower to Acceleration*
=> The *x-axis label* is changed from *Horsepower* to *Acceleration*
![](report_files/figure-gfm/Acceleration.png)

1. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis* 
=>Now *x-axis* became *Miles_per_Gallon* and *y-axi*s became *Acceleration*
![](report_files/figure-gfm/swap.png)

1. *Change Name to Origin.*
=> Changed name to origin but no changes is be seen
![](report_files/figure-gfm/origin.png)

1. *Remove the vl.y().fieldN("Origin") line.*
=> Only one field of total records is seen in the chart. No country record is available in this chart. 
![](report_files/figure-gfm/remove_y.png)

1. *Replace count() with average("Miles_per_Gallon").*
=>The average is shown in place of the count of records.
![](report_files/figure-gfm/average.png)
